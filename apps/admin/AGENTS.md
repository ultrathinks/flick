# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices. Notably, the `middleware` file convention is deprecated and renamed to `proxy` (`src/proxy.ts`).

# apps/admin

Platform-operator back-office (Next.js 16 App Router + React 19). Operators approve/reject booths, monitor all orders, view student payout accounts (환급 — the bank account each student's leftover balance is returned to after the festival; read-only, no approval/pay flow), charge balances by scanning user QR codes (충전), search users, and read the audit trail. There is no order-refund concept anywhere in the system — a paid order is terminal.

## Run

- Dev: `pnpm dev` (port 3003)
- Build: `pnpm build` (`next build`); lint: `pnpm lint` (root Biome config — no nested config)
- Env: copy `.env.example`. All config is server-side (no `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). Needs a registered DAuth client (`DAUTH_CLIENT_ID`) whose redirect URI matches `DAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` and the API's `DAUTH_ADMIN_REDIRECT_URI`. `BASE_API_URL` is the API URL; `BASE_INTERNAL_API_URL` (optional, falls back to `BASE_API_URL`) is used for server-to-server calls.

## Structure (FSD + App Router)

- `src/app/` — routes + route handlers. Import direction `shared → entities → features → widgets → app`. Alias `@/*`. Relative imports keep the `.ts`/`.tsx` extension.
- Auth: DAuth Authorization Code + PKCE, cloned from pos with `flick_admin_*` cookies. `GET /api/auth/login` starts the flow; `GET /api/auth/callback` exchanges the code via the API's `POST /v1/auth/admin`. Tokens are never exposed to client JS.
- `src/app/api/proxy/[...path]` — same-origin proxy that injects the bearer cookie and refreshes on 401 (via `rotateSession`, the single write-path helper). The `ky` client targets `/api/proxy`.

## Admin gate (two layers, defense-in-depth)

- `src/proxy.ts` (Next 16 proxy, not middleware) does an optimistic redirect to `/login` when no session cookie is present, and sets an `x-pathname` request header for server components. Matcher excludes `login`/`api`/static/metadata. It never reads the DB or writes cookies (Next: cookie writes are only allowed in Route Handlers/Server Actions).
- `src/app/(protected)/layout.tsx` is a server component that calls the read-only DAL `getSessionState` (`shared/auth/me.ts`, memoized with React `cache()`). It returns `authenticated`/`expired`/`unauthenticated`: `unauthenticated` → `redirect('/login')`, `!isAdmin` → `redirect('/login?error=forbidden')`, and `expired` (access invalid but refresh cookie present) → `redirect('/api/auth/refresh?next=…')`. The DAL performs no cookie writes; token rotation happens only in Route Handlers (`/api/auth/refresh` and the `/api/proxy` on-401 path), which is why the earlier "Cookies can only be modified in a Server Action or Route Handler" crash is gone.
- Security is ultimately enforced by the API's `requireAdmin`; the front gate is UX + defense-in-depth. `isAdmin` is set directly in the DB (no env allowlist).

## Data & pagination

- List screens (users/orders/audit) use cursor (keyset) pagination via `shared/api/cursor.ts` (`useCursorQuery`) + `widgets/data-table` (declarative columns, handles loading/empty/error/load-more). The API returns `{ items, nextCursor }`.
- 충전 flow: scan user QR (`@zxing/browser`) or type the code → `POST /v1/user-codes/resolve` → confirm user → amount → `POST /v1/charges` (one `idempotencyKey` per resolve→charge session). No code-level fallbacks; the only fallback is manual code entry, still verified by the same resolve API.

## Design

- UI comes from **`@flick/ui`** (re-exported via `@/shared/ui`). Semantic tokens only — no `zinc-*`/hex. `globals.css` imports `@flick/ui/styles.css`. `next.config.ts` sets `transpilePackages: ["@flick/ui"]`.
- `@flick/ui` has no table component; `widgets/data-table` is admin-local, built only from `@flick/ui` tokens/components, promotable to `@flick/ui` if another app needs it.

## Mock mode & tests

- **Mock dev**: `pnpm dev:mock` runs the app fully mocked, no API server and no login — gated by `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK=1` (the script injects dummy `BASE_*`/`DAUTH_*`). MSW handlers live in `src/mocks/`: `handlers.ts` exports `createHandlers(base)` (single source of truth). Browser `ky` calls hit the same-origin `/api/proxy/*` route, which forwards server-side to `BASE_INTERNAL_API_URL`; that forward and the RSC `getSessionState` fetch are what MSW intercepts, via the Node server (`node.ts`, started from `instrumentation.ts`) mounted at `BASE_INTERNAL_API_URL`. No browser Service Worker — the server proxy already covers all client traffic. Cursor lists return `{ items, nextCursor }`; the mock `users/me` sets `isAdmin: true` so the admin gate passes. `next.config.ts` marks `msw`/`@mswjs/interceptors` as `serverExternalPackages`.
- **Auth gate in mock mode**: the cookie gates (`proxy.ts`, `(protected)/layout.tsx` `isAdmin` check, proxy route) check for a session cookie before any fetch. Visit `GET /api/mock/seed` once (flag-gated; 404 when off) — it seeds fake `flick_admin_*` cookies and redirects to `/`. No production auth/proxy code is touched.
- **Unit/integration tests**: `pnpm test` (`vitest run`). Config: `vitest.config.ts` (jsdom + `@vitejs/plugin-react`), `vitest.setup.ts` (starts `src/mocks/server.ts` — the handlers mounted at both `/api/proxy` and `BASE_INTERNAL_API_URL` — with `beforeAll/afterEach/afterAll`, stubs `matchMedia`, restores relative-URL resolution for `ky`). Shared render helper: `src/test/render.tsx`. Vitest cannot render async Server Components, so tests cover client components/widgets, cursor + plain hooks, and entity/feature API logic through MSW — not `(protected)/layout.tsx` or the DAL.
- **E2E tests**: `pnpm test:e2e` (`playwright test`, Chromium). `playwright.config.ts` boots `pnpm dev:mock` as its `webServer`; specs live in `e2e/`. `e2e/fixtures.ts` extends `page` to hit `/api/mock/seed` first, so authed specs start signed in as an admin. E2E covers what Vitest can't: the async Server Component `isAdmin` gate + full navigation flow over the mocked backend.

## Notes

- TS config extends `@flick/typescript-config/nextjs.json`. No nested lockfile/workspace/biome config — use the repo root. Test tooling (`vitest`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `jsdom`, `@testing-library/*`, `msw`) is an admin-local devDependency; it never ships in the Next runtime.
